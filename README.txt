This project was designed to support logging demonstrator hours at Newcastle University. 

To initialise the system a MySQL database should be running on the host machine. The login credentials should be stored in a file called pwd.txt. Ideally to setup the system you should seed a list of demonstrators although they can be updated with new entries.
