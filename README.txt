This project was designed to support logging demonstrator hours at Newcastle University. 

To initialise the system a MySQL database should be running on the host machine. The login credentials should be stored in a the 'database.properties' file within the resources directory in the source code. 

Ideally to setup the system you should seed the database with a list of demonstrators and modules although they can be updated with new entries.
